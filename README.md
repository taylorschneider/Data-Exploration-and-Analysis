# Data-Exploration-and-Analysis
Assignments from my Data exploration and analysis class
Hello! These are assignments I have completed during my Masters of Data Science. 
They are in R and primarily deal with cleaning, exploring, and visualising data from CSV files. 
These are simple projects, but a great start to show my capabilities. 
Hopefully they help anyone working on something similar!
